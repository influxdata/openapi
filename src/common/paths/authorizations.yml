    Lists authorizations.

    To limit which authorizations are returned, pass query parameters in your request.
    If no query parameters are passed, InfluxDB returns all authorizations.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - InfluxDB OSS returns
      [API token]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#token) values in authorizations.
    - If the request uses an  _[operator token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/#operator-token)_,
      InfluxDB OSS returns authorizations for all organizations in the instance.

    #### Required permissions

    - An _[operator token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/#operator-token)_.

  summary: Create an authorization
  description: |
    Creates an authorization and returns the authorization with the
    generated API [token]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#token).

    Use this endpoint to create an authorization, which generates an API token
    with permissions to `read` or `write` to a specific resource or `type` of resource.
    The response contains the new authorization with the generated API token.

    #### Limitations

    To follow best practices for secure API token generation and retrieval,
    InfluxDB enforces access restrictions on API tokens.

    - In InfluxDB OSS, API tokens are visible to the user who created the authorization and to any
      user with an _[operator token]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/security/tokens/#operator-token)_.
    - You can't update an authorization's permissions.
    - Even if an API token has `read-authorizations` permission, the
      token can't be used to view its authorization details.
    - A token stops working when the user who created the authorization is deleted.

    We recommend creating a generic user to create and manage tokens for writing data.
