  summary: Update a password
  description: |
    Updates the password for the signed-in user.

    This endpoint represents the third step in the following three-step process to let a
    user with a user session update their password:
      1. Pass the user's [Basic authentication credentials](#section/Authentication/BasicAuthentication) to the `POST /api/v2/signin`
         endpoint to create a user session and generate a session cookie.
      2. From the response in the first step, extract the session cookie (`Set-Cookie`) header.
      3. Pass the following in a request to the `PUT /api/v2/me/password` endpoint:
         - The `Set-Cookie` header from the second step
         - The `Authorization Basic` header with the user's _Basic authentication_ credentials
         - `{"password": "NEW_PASSWORD"}` in the request body
