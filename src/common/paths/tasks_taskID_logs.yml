  summary: Retrieve all logs for a task
  description: |
    Retrieves a list of all logs for a [task]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#task).

    When an InfluxDB task runs, a “run” record is created in the task’s history.
    Logs associated with each run provide relevant log messages, timestamps, and the exit status of the run attempt.

    Use this endpoint to retrieve only the log events for a task,
    without additional task metadata.
  parameters:
    - $ref: "../parameters/TraceSpan.yml"
    - in: path
      name: taskID

  responses:
    "200":
      description: |
       Success. The response body contains an `events` list with logs for the task.
       Each log event `message` contains detail about the event.
       If a task run fails, InfluxDB logs an event with the reason for the failure.
