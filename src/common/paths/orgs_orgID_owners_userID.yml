  summary: Remove an owner from an organization
  description: |
    Removes an [owner]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#owner) from
    the organization.

    Organization owners have permission to delete organizations and remove user and member
    permissions from the organization.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud
    - Doesn't use `owner` and `member` roles.
      Use [`/api/v2/authorizations`](#tag/Authorizations) to assign user permissions.

    #### Limitations
    - Owner permissions are separate from API token permissions.
    - Owner permissions are used in the context of the InfluxDB UI.

    #### Required permissions
    - `write-orgs INFLUX_ORG_ID`
    `INFLUX_ORG_ID` is the ID of the organization that you want remove an owner
    from.
