        The error may indicate one of the following problems:

        - The request body isn't valid--the request is well-formed,
          but InfluxDB can't process it due to semantic errors.
        - You passed a parameter combination that InfluxDB doesn't support.

  summary: Create a user
  description: |
    Creates a user that can access InfluxDB. The response contains the new user.

    Use this endpoint to create a user that can sign in to start a [user session]()
    through one of the following interfaces:

      - InfluxDB UI
      - `/api/v2/signin` InfluxDB API endpoint.
      - InfluxDB CLI

    This endpoint represents the first two steps in a four-step process to allow a user
    to sign in with a username and password and then access data in an organization:

      1. Send a `POST` request to `/api/v2/users` to create a user. `name` is required.
      2. Extract the `id` value from the API response for step 1.
      3. Send a `POST` request to any of the following endpoints, passing the user ID from step 2:

        - [`/api/v2/authorizations`](): creates an [authorization]() with [permissions]() and an [API token]() scoped to the user.
        - [`/api/v2/organizations/ORG_ID/members`](): adds the user as a [member]() of an organization.
        - [`/api/v2/organizations/ORG_ID/owners`](): adds the user as an [owner]() of an organization.
      4. Send a `POST` request to [`/api/v2/users/USER_ID/password`](), passing the user ID from step 2, to create a password for the user.
