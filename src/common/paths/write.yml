    Writes data to a bucket.

    Use this endpoint to send data in [line protocol]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) format to InfluxDB.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - Takes the following steps when you send a write request:

      1. Validates the request and queues the write.
      2. If the write is queued, responds with an HTTP `204` status code.
      3. Handles the write asynchronously and reaches eventual consistency.

      An HTTP `2xx` status code acknowledges that the write or delete is queued.
      To ensure that InfluxDB Cloud handles writes and deletes in the order you request them,
      wait for a response before you send the next request.

      Because writes are asynchronous, data might not yet be written
      when you receive the response.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - Validates the request, handles the write synchronously,
      and then responds with success or failure.
    - If all points were written successfully, returns `204`,
      otherwise returns the first line that failed.

    #### Required permissions

    - `write-buckets` or `write-bucket BUCKET_ID`.

      `BUCKET_ID` is the ID of the destination bucket.

    #### Rate limits (with InfluxDB Cloud)

    `write` rate limits apply.
    For more information, see [limits and adjustable quotas](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/).

      Data in line protocol format.

      To send compressed data, do the following:

        1. Use [GZIP](https://www.gzip.org/) to compress the line protocol data.
        2. In your request, send the compressed data and the
           `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.

        Writes only return a response body if they fail--for example,
