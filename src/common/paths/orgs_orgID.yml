    Deletes an organization.

    Deleting an organization from InfluxDB Cloud cannot be undone.
    Once deleted, all data associated with the organization is removed.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - Does the following when you send a delete request:

      1. Validates the request and queues the delete.
      2. Returns an HTTP `204` status code if queued; _error_ otherwise.
      3. Handles the delete asynchronously.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - Validates the request, handles the delete synchronously,
    and then responds with success or failure.

    #### Limitations

    - Only one organization can be deleted per request.
