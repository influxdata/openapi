  summary: Create a user session.
  description: |
    Authenticates [Basic authentication credentials](#section/Authentication/BasicAuthentication)
    for a [user]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#user),
    and then, if successful, generates a user session.

    To authenticate a user, pass the HTTP `Authorization` header with the
    `Basic` scheme and the base64-encoded username and password.
    For syntax and more information, see [Basic Authentication](#section/Authentication/BasicAuthentication) for
    syntax and more information.

    If authentication is successful, InfluxDB creates a new session for the user
    and then returns the session cookie in the `Set-Cookie` response header.

    User sessions exist only in memory.
    They expire within ten minutes and during restarts of the InfluxDB instance.

    #### User sessions with authorizations

    - In InfluxDB Cloud, a user session inherits all the user's permissions for
      the organization.
    - In InfluxDB OSS, a user session inherits all the user's permissions for all
      the organizations that the user belongs to.
