    Updates a bucket.

    Use this endpoint to update properties
    (`name`, `description`, and `retentionRules`) of a bucket.
    
    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - `retentionRules` must be sent in the request body. Failure to do so will
    result in an HTTP `403` status code.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - `retentionRules` isn't required.

  summary: Delete a bucket
  description: | 
    Deletes a bucket and all associated records.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - Does the following when you send a delete request:
      1. Validates the request and queues the delete.
      2. Returns an HTTP `204` status code if queued; _error_ otherwise.
      3. Handles the delete asynchronously.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - Validates the request, handles the delete synchronously,
    and then responds with success or failure.

    #### Limitations

    - Only one bucket can be deleted per request.
