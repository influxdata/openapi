  summary: Retrieve all query functions
  description: |
    Returns a list of all query functions.

    Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of all the possible query functions
    that InfluxData currently supports. The endpoint additionally exposes helper
    functions that are not meant to be used while building a query such as
    [`_sortLimit()`](https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/a768568a4cbeb299433ee31a059e599d290fcfbf/libflux/flux/benches/everything.flux#L2247)

    #### Limitations

    - The endpoint does not return all of the functions in the Flux standard
    library. It only returns query functions.
