  summary: Retrieve Flux query suggestions
  description: |
    Retrieves a list of Flux query suggestions. Each suggestion contains a
    [Flux function](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/stdlib/all-functions/)
    name and parameters.

    Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of Flux query suggestions used in the
    InfluxDB Flux Query Builder. Helper function names have an underscore (`_`)
    prefix and shouldn't be used  in queries--for example:

    - **Not recommended**: Don't use the `_sortLimit` helper function directly.
       - **Recommended**:  Use `top(n, columns=["_value"], tables=<-)` to sort
        on a column and keep the top n records. `top` uses the `_sortLimit` helper function.

    #### Limitations

    - Using `/api/v2/query/suggestions/` (note the trailing slash) with cURL
    will result in a HTTP `301 Moved Permanently` status code. Please use
    `/api/v2/query/suggestions` without a trailing slash.

    - When writing a query, avoid using `_functionName()` helper functions
    exposed by this endpoint.
