  summary: List Flux query suggestions
  description: |
    Lists Flux query suggestions. Each suggestion contains a
    [Flux function](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/stdlib/all-functions/)
    name and parameters.

    Use this endpoint to retrieve a list of Flux query suggestions used in the
    InfluxDB Flux Query Builder.

    #### Limitations

    - When writing a query, avoid using `_functionName()` helper functions
    exposed by this endpoint.  Helper function names have an underscore (`_`)
    prefix and aren't meant to be used directly in queries--for example:

      - To sort on a column and keep the top n records, use the
        `top(n, columns=["_value"], tables=<-)` function instead of the `_sortLimit`
        helper function. `top` uses `_sortLimit`.
