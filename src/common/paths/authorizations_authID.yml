    Retrieves an authorization.

    Use this endpoint to retrieve information about an API token, including
    the token's permissions and the user that the token is scoped to.

    #### InfluxDB OSS

    - InfluxDB OSS returns
      [API token]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#token) values in authorizations.
    - If the request uses an _[operator token](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/#operator-token)_,
      InfluxDB OSS returns authorizations for all organizations in the instance.
