  summary: List all owners of a bucket
  description: |
    Lists all [owners]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#owner)
    of a bucket.

    Bucket owners have permission to delete buckets and remove user and member
    permissions from the bucket.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - Doesn't use `owner` and `member` roles.
      Use [`/api/v2/authorizations`](#tag/Authorizations) to assign user permissions.

    #### Limitations

    - Owner permissions are separate from API token permissions.
    - Owner permissions are used in the context of the InfluxDB UI.

    #### Required permissions

    - `read-orgs INFLUX_ORG_ID`

    *`INFLUX_ORG_ID`* is the ID of the organization that you want to retrieve a
    list of owners for.
