  summary: Remove an owner from a bucket
  description: |
    Removes an owner from a bucket.

    Use this endpoint to remove a user's `owner` role for a bucket.

    #### InfluxDB Cloud

    - Doesn't use `owner` and `member` roles.
      Use [`/api/v2/authorizations`](#tag/Authorizations) to assign user permissions.

    #### Limitations

    - Owner permissions are separate from API token permissions.
    - Owner permissions are used in the context of the InfluxDB UI.

    #### Required permissions

    - `write-orgs INFLUX_ORG_ID`
    `INFLUX_ORG_ID` is the ID of the organization that you want add an owner for.
