  The InfluxDB API uses standard HTTP status codes for success and failure responses.
  The response body may include additional details. For details about a specific operation's response, see **Responses** and **Response Samples** for that operation.

  API operations may return the following HTTP status codes:

  | &nbsp;Code&nbsp; | Status                   | Description           |
  |:-----------:|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |
  | `200`       | Success                  |                       |                       
  | `204`       | No content               | For a `POST` request, `204` indicates that InfluxDB accepted the request and request data is valid. Asynchronous operations, such as `write`, might not have completed yet. |
  | `400`       | Bad request              | `Authorization` header is missing or malformed or the API token does not have permission for the operation. |
  | `401`       | Unauthorized             | May indicate one of the following: <li>`Authorization: Token` header is missing or malformed</li><li>API token value is missing from the header</li><li>API token does not have permission. For more information about token types and permissions, see [Manage API tokens]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/security/tokens/)</li> |
  | `404`       | Not found                | Requested resource was not found. `message` in the response body contains details about the requested resource. | 
  | `413`       | Request entity too large | Request payload exceeds the size limit. |
  | `429`       | Too many requests        | API token is temporarily over the request quota. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
  | `500`       | Internal server error    |                       |
  | `503`       | Service unavailable      | Server is temporarily unavailable to process the request. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
