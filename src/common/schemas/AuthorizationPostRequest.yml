            When a user authenticates with username and password,
            InfluxDB generates a _user session_ with all the permissions
            specified by all the user's authorizations.

          description: |
            A list of permissions for an authorization.
            In the list, provide at least one `permission` object.

            In a `permission`, the `resource.type` property grants access to all
            resources of the specified type.
            To grant access to only a specific resource, specify the
            `resource.id` property.
