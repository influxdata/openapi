        Key-value pairs passed as parameters during query execution.

        To use parameters in your query, pass a _`query`_ with `params` references (in dot notation)--for example:

        ```json
          query: "from(bucket: params.mybucket) |> range(start: params.rangeStart) |> limit(n:1)"
        ```

        and pass _`params`_ with the key-value pairs--for example:

        ```json
          params: {
            "mybucket": "environment",
            "rangeStart": "-30d"
          }
        ```

        During query execution, InfluxDB passes _`params`_ to your script and substitutes the values.

        #### Limitations

        - If you use _`params`_, you can't use _`extern`_.
