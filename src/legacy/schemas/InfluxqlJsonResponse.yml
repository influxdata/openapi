 The JSON response for an InfluxQL query.

 A response contains the collection of results for a query.
 `results` is an array of resultset objects.

 If the response is chunked, the `transfer-encoding` response header is set to `chunked` and each resultset object is sent in a separate JSON object.

        A resultset object that contains the `statement_id` and the `series` array.

        series:
          type: array
          description: |
