      Create and manage authorizations (API tokens).

      An _authorization_ contains a list of `read` and `write`
      permissions for organization resources and provides an API token for authentication.
      An authorization belongs to an organization and only contains permissions for that organization.

      In InfluxDB Cloud, an authorization with `read-authorizations` permission
      can be used to view other authorizations.
      Optionally, when creating an authorization, you can scope it to a specific user.

      #### Limitations

      To follow best practices for secure API token generation and retrieval,
      InfluxDB Cloud enforces access restrictions on API tokens.

      - InfluxDB Cloud only allows access to the API token value immediately after the authorization is created.
      - You can’t change access (read/write) permissions for an API token after it’s created.
      - Tokens stop working when the user who created the token is deleted.

      We recommend the following for managing your tokens:

      - Create a generic user to create and manage tokens for writing data.
      - Store your tokens in a secure password vault for future access.

      #### User sessions with authorizations

      If a user signs in with username and password, creating a _user session_,
      the session carries the permissions granted by all the user's authorizations.
      To create a user session, use the [`POST /api/v2/signin`](#operation/PostSignin) endpoint.

      Store your data in InfluxDB [buckets]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#bucket).
      A bucket is a named location where time series data is stored. All buckets
      have a [retention period]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/reference/glossary/#retention-period),
      a duration of time that each data point persists. InfluxDB drops all
      points with timestamps older than the bucket’s retention period.
      A bucket belongs to an organization.

  - name: Invokable Scripts
    description: |
      Manage and execute scripts as API endpoints in InfluxDB.

      An API Invokable Script assigns your custom Flux script to a new
      InfluxDB API endpoint for your organization.
      Invokable scripts let you execute your script as an HTTP request to the endpoint.

      Invokable scripts accept parameters.
      Add parameter references in your script as `params.myparameter`.
      When you `invoke` your script, you send parameters as key-value pairs in the `params` object.
      Then, InfluxDB executes your script with the key-value pairs as arguments, and returns the result.

      Process and analyze your data with tasks in the InfluxDB task engine.
      With tasks, you can schedule Flux scripts to query, analyze, modify, and act on data.
      In InfluxDB Cloud, you can create tasks that run [invokable scripts](#tag/Invokable-Scripts)
      with parameters.

      Use the `/api/v2/tasks` endpoints to create and manage tasks, retry task runs, and retrieve run logs.

  - name: Templates
    description: |
      Export and apply InfluxDB **templates**.
      Manage **stacks** of templated InfluxDB resources.

      InfluxDB templates are prepackaged configurations for
      everything from dashboards and Telegraf to notifications and alerts.
      Use InfluxDB templates to quickly configure a fresh instance of InfluxDB,
      back up your dashboard configuration, or share your configuration with the
      InfluxData community.

      Use the `/api/v2/templates` endpoints to export templates and apply templates.

      **InfluxDB stacks** are stateful InfluxDB templates that let you
      add, update, and remove installed template resources over time, avoid duplicating
      resources when applying the same or similar templates more than once, and
      apply changes to distributed instances of InfluxDB OSS or InfluxDB Cloud.

      Use the `/api/v2/stacks` endpoints to manage installed template resources.

      Retrieve specific users.

      InfluxDB Cloud lets you invite and collaborate with multiple users in your organization.
      To invite and remove users from your organization, use the InfluxDB Cloud user interface (UI);
      you can't use the InfluxDB API to manage users in InfluxDB Cloud.
      Once a user is added to your organization, you can use the
      `GET /api/v2/users` and `GET /api/v2/users/USER_ID` API endpoints to
      view specific members.

      #### User sessions with authorizations

      Optionally, you can scope an authorization (and its API token) to a user.
      If a user signs in with username and password, creating a _user session_,
      the session carries the permissions granted by all the user's authorizations.
      To create a user session, use the [`POST /api/v2/signin`](#operation/PostSignin) endpoint.

  - name: Headers
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      InfluxDB API endpoints use standard HTTP request and response headers.

      **Note**: Not all operations support all headers.

      ### Request headers

      | Header                   | Value type            | Description                                |
      |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
      | `Accept`                 | string                | The content type that the client can understand. |
      | `Authorization`          | string                | The authorization scheme and credential. |
      | `Content-Encoding`       | string                | The compression applied to the line protocol in the request payload. |
      | `Content-Length`         | integer               | The size of the entity-body, in bytes, sent to the database. |
      | `Content-Type`           | string                | The format of the data in the request body. |
  - name: Response codes
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      The InfluxDB API uses standard HTTP status codes for success and failure responses.
      The response body may include additional details. For details about a specific operation's response, see **Responses** and **Response Samples** for that operation.

      API operations may return the following HTTP status codes:

      | &nbsp;Code&nbsp; | Status                   | Description      |
      |:-----------:|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |
      | `200`       | Success                  |                       |
      | `204`       | No content               | For a `POST` request, `204` indicates that InfluxDB accepted the request and request data is valid. Asynchronous operations, such as `write`, might not have completed yet. |
      | `400`       | Bad request              | May indicate one of the following: <ul><li>Line protocol is malformed. The response body contains the first malformed line in the data and indicates what was expected. For partial writes, the number of points written and the number of points rejected are also included. For more information, check the `rejected_points` measurement in your `_monitoring` bucket.</li><li>`Authorization` header is missing or malformed or the API token doesn't have permission for the operation.</li></ul> |
      | `401`       | Unauthorized             | May indicate one of the following: <ul><li>`Authorization: Token` header is missing or malformed</li><li>API token value is missing from the header</li><li>API token doesn't have permission. For more information about token types and permissions, see [Manage API tokens](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/)</li></ul> |
      | `404`       | Not found                | Requested resource was not found. `message` in the response body provides details about the requested resource. |
      | `413`       | Request entity too large | Request payload exceeds the size limit. |
      | `422`       | Unprocessable entity     | Request data is invalid. `code` and `message` in the response body provide details about the problem. |
      | `429`       | Too many requests        | API token is temporarily over the request quota. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
      | `500`       | Internal server error    |                       |
      | `503`       | Service unavailable      | Server is temporarily unavailable to process the request. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
