      Create and manage API tokens.
      An **authorization** associates a list of permissions to an
      **organization** and provides a token for API access.
      Optionally, you can restrict an authorization and its token to a specific user.

    description: |
      Manage and execute scripts as API endpoints in InfluxDB.

      An API Invokable Script assigns your custom Flux script to a new
      InfluxDB API endpoint for your organization.
      Invokable scripts let you execute your script as an HTTP request to the endpoint.

      Invokable scripts accept parameters.
      Add parameter references in your script as `params.myparameter`.
      When you `invoke` your script, you send parameters as key-value pairs in the `params` object.
      Then, InfluxDB executes your script with the key-value pairs as arguments, and returns the result.

      Process and analyze your data with tasks in the InfluxDB task engine.
      With tasks, you can schedule Flux scripts to query, analyze, modify, and act on data.
      In InfluxDB Cloud, you can create tasks that run [invokable scripts](#tag/Invokable-Scripts)
      with parameters.

      Use the `/api/v2/tasks` endpoints to create and manage tasks, retry task runs, and retrieve run logs.

      Many InfluxDB API endpoints require parameters to specify resources--for example,
      writing to a **bucket** in an **organization**.

      ### Common query parameters

      | Query parameter          | Value type            | Description                                |
      |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
      | `bucket`                 | string                | The bucket name or ID ([find your bucket]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/buckets/view-buckets/). |
      | `bucketID`               | string                | The bucket ID ([find your bucket]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/buckets/view-buckets/). |
      | `org`                    | string                | The organization name or ID ([find your organization]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/view-orgs/). |
      | `orgID`                  | 16-byte string        | The organization ID ([find your organization]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/view-orgs/). |
  - name: Headers
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      InfluxDB API endpoints use standard HTTP request and response headers.

      **Note**: Not all operations support all headers.

      ### Request headers

      | Header                   | Value type            | Description                                |
      |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
      | `Accept`                 | string                | The content type that the client can understand. |
      | `Authorization`          | string                | The authorization scheme and credential. |
      | `Content-Encoding`       | string                | The compression applied to the line protocol in the request payload. |
      | `Content-Length`         | integer               | The size of the entity-body, in bytes, sent to the database. |
      | `Content-Type`           | string                | The format of the data in the request body. |
  - name: Response codes
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      The InfluxDB API uses standard HTTP status codes for success and failure responses.
      The response body may include additional details. For details about a specific operation's response, see **Responses** and **Response Samples** for that operation.

      API operations may return the following HTTP status codes:

      | &nbsp;Code&nbsp; | Status                   | Description      |
      |:-----------:|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |
      | `200`       | Success                  |                       |
      | `204`       | No content               | For a `POST` request, `204` indicates that InfluxDB accepted the request and request data is valid. Asynchronous operations, such as `write`, might not have completed yet. |
      | `400`       | Bad request              | May indicate one of the following: <ul><li>Line protocol is malformed. The response body contains the first malformed line in the data and indicates what was expected. For partial writes, the number of points written and the number of points rejected are also included. For more information, check the `rejected_points` measurement in your `_monitoring` bucket.</li><li>`Authorization` header is missing or malformed or the API token does not have permission for the operation.</li></ul> |
      | `401`       | Unauthorized             | May indicate one of the following: <ul><li>`Authorization: Token` header is missing or malformed</li><li>API token value is missing from the header</li><li>API token does not have permission. For more information about token types and permissions, see [Manage API tokens](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/)</li></ul> |
      | `404`       | Not found                | Requested resource was not found. `message` in the response body provides details about the requested resource. |
      | `413`       | Request entity too large | Request payload exceeds the size limit. |
      | `422`       | Unprocessable entity     | Request data is invalid. `code` and `message` in the response body provide details about the problem. |
      | `429`       | Too many requests        | API token is temporarily over the request quota. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
      | `500`       | Internal server error    |                       |
      | `503`       | Service unavailable      | Server is temporarily unavailable to process the request. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
