      Create and manage API tokens.
      An **authorization** associates a list of permissions to an
      **organization** and provides a token for API access.
      Optionally, you can restrict an authorization and its token to a specific user.

      Generates profiling and trace reports.

      Use routes under `/debug/pprof` to analyze the Go runtime of InfluxDB.
      These endpoints generate [Go runtime profiles](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof)
      and **trace** reports.
      **Profiles** are collections of stack traces that show call sequences
      leading to instances of a particular event, such as allocation.

      For more information about **pprof profile** and **trace** reports,
      see the following resources:

  - name: Common parameters
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      Many InfluxDB API endpoints require parameters to specify resources--for example,
      writing to a **bucket** in an **organization**.

      ### Common query parameters

      | Query parameter          | Value type            | Description                                |
      |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
      | `bucket`                 | string                | The bucket name or ID ([find your bucket]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/buckets/view-buckets/). |
      | `bucketID`               | string                | The bucket ID ([find your bucket]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/buckets/view-buckets/). |
      | `org`                    | string                | The organization name or ID ([find your organization]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/view-orgs/). |
      | `orgID`                  | 16-byte string        | The organization ID ([find your organization]({{% INFLUXDB_DOCS_URL %}}/organizations/view-orgs/). |
  - name: Headers
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      InfluxDB API endpoints use standard HTTP request and response headers.

      **Note**: Not all operations support all headers.

      ### Request headers

      | Header                   | Value type            | Description                                |
      |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
      | `Accept`                 | string                | The content type that the client can understand. |
      | `Authorization`          | string                | The authorization scheme and credential. |
      | `Content-Encoding`       | string                | The compression applied to the line protocol in the request payload. |
      | `Content-Length`         | integer               | The size of the entity-body, in bytes, sent to the database. |
      | `Content-Type`           | string                | The format of the data in the request body. |
  - name: Response codes
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      InfluxDB API endpoints use standard HTTP status codes for success and failure responses.
      The response body may include additional details.
      For details about a specific operation's response,
      see **Responses** and **Response Samples** for that operation.

      API operations may return the following HTTP status codes:

      | &nbsp;Code&nbsp; | Status                   | Description      |
      |:-----------:|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |
      | `200`       | Success                  |                       |
      | `204`       | No content               | For a `POST` request, `204` indicates that InfluxDB accepted the request and request data is valid. Asynchronous operations, such as `write`, might not have completed yet. |
      | `400`       | Bad request              | `Authorization` header is missing or malformed or the API token does not have permission for the operation. |
      | `401`       | Unauthorized             | May indicate one of the following: <li>`Authorization: Token` header is missing or malformed</li><li>API token value is missing from the header</li><li>API token does not have permission. For more information about token types and permissions, see [Manage API tokens](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/security/tokens/)</li> |
      | `404`       | Not found                | Requested resource was not found. `message` in the response body provides details about the requested resource. |
      | `413`       | Request entity too large | Request payload exceeds the size limit. |
      | `422`       | Unprocessible entity     | Request data is invalid. `code` and `message` in the response body provide details about the problem. |
      | `429`       | Too many requests        | API token is temporarily over the request quota. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
      | `500`       | Internal server error    |                       |
      | `503`       | Service unavailable      | Server is temporarily unavailable to process the request. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the request again. |
